        fulltext: 'The Magical Unicorn Society has members across the globe dedicated to discovering more about how unicorns spread their magic. Each explorer has a unique story to tell, and they document the unicorns from the tops of the Himalayas to the waters of the Mediterranean. The Golden Unicorn was discovered frozen in ice by Hana and Jakob in Norway. A Water Moon unicorn helped Selena escape from a dangerous encounter with pirates. Amber Li was even helped by a Storm Chaser unicorn when she wanted to play soccer on a rainy day.',

        title: 'A Galaxy of Sea Stars',
        fulltext: 'For Izzy Mancini, the beginning of 6th grade is not going as planned. Her lifelong friends, the Sea Stars, are drifting apart, her parents separated over the summer, and she has moved. To top it off, a new girl, Sitara, moved in next door. She’s an immigrant from Afghanistan, and she eats different food and wears a hijab. As Izzy struggles to accept this new friendship, she finds comfort and direction in the nearby harbor and from her role model, Marie Tharp, a scientist who made groundbreaking oceanic discoveries. Eventually, Izzy learns to navigate the changes in her life and make her own deep discoveries, opening her heart to see that there is a galaxy of Sea Stars to befriend.',

        title: 'Civil Rights as Human Rights',
        fulltext: 'During the early 1960s, government officials in the U.S. Department of State grappled with the following quandary: How could the United States shape and lead a racially diverse world while still denying rights to Black Americans domestically? One way the State Department set out to resolve this disconnect was through diplomacy and negotiations at the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, which crafted the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Although extensive documentation exists on the exchanges between the Sub-Commission, the State Department, and the U.S. civil rights community, existing literature fails to examine these rich exchanges in sufficient detail. This Article explores how the United States shaped international human rights regimes through the Sub- Commission, and, in turn, how international affairs shaped the U.S. civil rights movement.\n' +

            'One underexplored aspect of the interplay between the U.S. civil rights movement and the international human rights regime is how the State Department interfaced with the Sub-Commission. By exploring the exchanges between the two high-profile civil rights lawyers the State Department sent to negotiate with the Sub-Commission and other actors at the United Nations, this Article highlights the tension between these lawyers’ values and the U.S. diplomatic agenda. This tension in turn magnifies how the U.S. civil rights movement and the international human rights regime shaped one another.\n' +

            'The history of how the U.S. delegation sought to imbue the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination with U.S. values remains central to this Article’s discussion. And, at the heart of this contribution was the importation of the state action doctrine. Thus, the doctrine that had vexed civil rights activists’ domestic litigation for decades became enshrined in the international human rights regime. This Article explores the role that the state action doctrine played in the reciprocal relationship between the U.S. civil rights movement and the international human rights regime.',

        title: 'Epidemiology and Outcomes of Hospitalized Adults with SARS-CoV-2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Louisville, Kentucky',
        fulltext: 'Background: During the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV-2 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been the primary cause of hospitalization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 1,013 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 CAP from September 2020 through March 2021 in Louisville, Kentucky.\n' +

            'Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of 1,013 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 CAP at eight of the adult hospitals in the city of Louisville from September 2020 through March 2021. Patients with 1) a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2, 2) fever, cough, or shortness of breath, and 3) an infiltrate on chest imaging were defined as having SARS-CoV-2 CAP. Data were abstracted from each hospital’s electronic health record. Descriptive statistics were performed on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP. Demographic characteristics of the study population were compared with census data from the city of Louisville. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics using R version 3.4.0.\n' +

            'Results: Of the 1,013 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 CAP, the median age was 65 years, 53% were males, 24% reported their race as African American or Black, and 6% identified as Hispanic. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (73%), obesity (56%), and diabetes (43%). At the time of admission, 60% required supplemental oxygen. The mortality rate was 19% for the total population and 45% for the 359 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). For each comorbidity, the proportion of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP was significantly different from the Louisville population (P\n' +

            'Conclusions: The elderly, males, and patients with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, or obesity are overrepresented among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP compared to the Louisville population. These patients are also more likely to require ICU care and experience worse clinical outcomes, with death occurring in approximately one in every five hospitalizations.',
